# Security Policy

Thank you for taking the time to responsibly disclose security issues in AudibleZenBot.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

Please do not open a public issue for security problems. Instead, send a private report to the repository owner:

- Preferred: Create a private security issue via GitHub Security (if available) or
- Email: contact@cstreible.dev (replace with your preferred contact)

When reporting, include:
- A description of the issue and impact
- Step-by-step reproduction steps and a minimal test case if possible
- The version of the project affected (commit SHA or release tag)
- Any PoC code or attachments (encrypted if sensitive)

If you need to send sensitive files, please encrypt them with my public key (PGP) or provide a secure transfer method and the method for decryption.

## Response Process

- Acknowledgement: We aim to acknowledge all valid reports within 72 hours.
- Triage: We'll evaluate severity and assign a priority within 5 business days.
- Fixes: We'll work to provide a remediation plan and release a patch or mitigation as appropriate.

## Disclosure Policy

We follow coordinated disclosure. Please do not publicly disclose a vulnerability until a patch or mitigation is available, or we agree on a disclosure timeline.

## Supported Versions

We currently support the latest released version. If unsure whether a version is supported, please include the commit SHA or release tag in your report.

## Contact

If you prefer, you can also contact the maintainer directly via their GitHub account: https://github.com/CStreible

Thank you for helping us keep this project secure.
